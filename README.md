The files here are what were written during YouTube videos. Feel free to use them as you wish. 

**Note** You will need an IEX account, and you can either directly add the token to your files (where I use `my_token.token`), or you can create a file called `my_token.py` in the same directory and make it look like this:

```
token = "pk_YOUR-IEX-KEY-HERE"
```
